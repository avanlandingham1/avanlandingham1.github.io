I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State devloping hybrid-electric rotorcraft. My research is at the intersection of multi-disciplinary design optimization, control system development, and powertrain testing. 

Previously, at Boeing, I worked as a Configuration Design Engineer in the Commercial Aircraft Product Developmet - Advanced Concepts group in Long Beach, CA. While at Boeing, I worked on various electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) concepts for commercial applications.
